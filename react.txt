        React
js library for creating UI
used to create user interfaces

Component - function(reusable)(invoke - call)

            JSX 
 (Javascript Extension Syntax)
(way of writing html inside js code)

JSX---->transfile by(Babel)---->JS

process to start new project
npm install vite
npm init
npm install
npm run dev (to start the server)


          scr(source)
assests(app.css,app.jsx,index.css,main.jsx) 

index.html(root)-->main.jsx<--app.jsx(render app)

Component is a reusable and independent piece of code.

Rendering a component
    Write as a html tag

Import 
import Title from "./Title.jsx";

Default Export
(to export single value from the file)
export default Title;

Named Export
export { Title };
import { Title } from "./Title.jsx";

Writing Markup in JSX
1. Return a single root element
2. Close all the tags
3. camelCase most of the things

React Fragment
Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
<> (empty tags)
</>

JSX with Curly Braces
{used as pure js}

Structuring Components
breaking into small components
eg. title component--->description component--->card component

Style Components
different css file for different components.

webpack- possible import/export in react

React Props
Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag.

Conditional
Adding elements on the basis of some condition

Events In React
Handling Click Events
Handling Non-Click Events

Event Object
Can access the event object in Handler

State in React
The state is a built-inn React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.A component's state can change over time;wherever it changes,the component re-renders.

Component ---> Function ---> Render
State ---> Object ---> Change in Object ---> Re-render

Hooks
A new addition in React 16.8.
They let us use state and other React features without writing a class.
Functions components + Hooks

useState()
It is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to the component.
const [state,setState] = useState(initialState);
returns an array with exactly two values.
Current state - it match the initalstate passed.
set function - update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

Closure
feature in javascript where an inner function has access to the outer(enclosing) function's variables.

Callback in Updater Function
Change in state when it depends on the current value
new state value --> old state value --> callback
